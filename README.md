# Speed-Tracking-Camera-Prototype
This my Open CV project in which I've made a basic but accurate speed tracking camera with the help of motion detection features.
It's firstly designed to calculate the car's speed using known parameters first. You need to caibrate by passing a vehicle with known speed first and then check the reading of the system. then correct the quation at the bottom of code : Speed = distance/time
Procedure:
first get the vehicle ready and decide the speed on which it'll be passed by at first.
then initialize the program and make sure nothing gets infornt of it other wise you need to restart the program.
then after the passes infront of camera, press button "q" to end program.
You'll be able to see estimated speed on terminal.
calibrate it accordingly.
